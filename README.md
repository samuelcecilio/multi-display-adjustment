# Multi Display Adjustment GNOME shell extension

Offers sliders to control external displays' brightness and contrast through DDC/CI.

A single _Displays_ entry in Quick Settings opens a menu where every connected display has its own
brightness and contrast sliders, under the display name that Settings shows.

Extension relies on `ddcutil-service`. Installation process of `ddcutil-service` is quick and non-intrusive. `ddcutil-service` allows more responsive communication with the displays than calling `ddcutil`.

## Dependencies

* GNOME 46-50
* [_ddcutil-service_](https://github.com/digitaltrails/ddcutil-service)

## Installation

This extension is not on [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org) yet, so it is installed
from a package built here. Grab the `.shell-extension.zip` of the
[latest release](https://github.com/samuelcecilio/multi-display-adjustment/releases/latest) and

```bash
gnome-extensions install --force multi-display-adjustment@cecilio.xyz.shell-extension.zip
```

Log out and back in, then enable it with

```bash
gnome-extensions enable multi-display-adjustment@cecilio.xyz
```

To build the package from a clone instead, run `make install` and log out and back in.
[dev.md](./dev.md) covers working on the extension itself.

## Installation of _ddcutil-service_

`ddcutil-service` can be installed from a package or built and installed from the source code.

### From a package

* [Ubuntu and Debian packages](https://gitlab.com/w8jcik/ddcutil-service.deb)
* [Arch AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ddcutil-service)
* [OpenSUSE packages](https://software.opensuse.org/package/ddcutil-service)

### Build by yourself

1. __Install dependencies `ddcutil`, `libddcutil` and `glib`__  

   On Ubuntu and Debian

   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential ddcutil libddcutil-dev libglib2.0-dev
   ```

   On Fedora (and likely other RPM based distributions)

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install make gcc ddcutil libddcutil-devel glib2-devel
   ```

2. __Build and install the service__

   ```bash
   git clone --branch v1.0.14 https://github.com/digitaltrails/ddcutil-service.git
   cd ddcutil-service
   make
   make install
   ```

   Service installs to `~/.local/share/dbus-1/services/com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.service` and  `~/.local/bin/ddcutil-service`. It is activated after the next login. You might have to reboot for `ddcutil` to detect your display.
