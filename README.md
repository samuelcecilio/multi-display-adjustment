# Multi Display Adjustment GNOME shell extension

Offers sliders in Quick Settings to control the brightness and contrast of external displays
through DDC/CI, one set per display, under the display name that Settings shows. Moving a slider
shows the level in the on-screen display of the screens it adjusts, as GNOME does for a laptop's
own screen.

Extension relies on `ddcutil-service`. Installation process of `ddcutil-service` is quick and non-intrusive. `ddcutil-service` allows more responsive communication with the displays than calling `ddcutil`.

## Two ways to show the sliders

* **Tile** (the default, left above) — a single _Displays_ entry in Quick Settings opens a menu
  where every display has a brightness and a contrast slider, each with its level as a number from
  0 to 100. The entry is hidden when there are no displays.
* **Inline** (right above) — no tile: every display gets a brightness slider among the sliders of
  Quick Settings, right next to the brightness slider of GNOME, or below the volume sliders on a
  desktop, which has none. They look and behave like the slider of GNOME. Only brightness is shown
  this way.

## Settings

Preferences open from _Display Adjustment Settings_ at the bottom of the tile's menu, or from the
gear next to the extension in the Extensions app, which is the only way with inline sliders.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Placement** | Tile | _Tile_ or _Inline_, see above. |
| **Position** | Below | With inline sliders, whether they go _Below_ or _Above_ the brightness slider of GNOME. With a display above the laptop, _Above_ makes the sliders read in the same order as the screens. Has no effect on a desktop, which has no brightness slider of its own. |
| **Minimum brightness of 1%** | On | Keeps brightness from going below 1, since some displays turn the backlight off at 0 and leave no way to see the slider again. Turn it off to let the sliders go all the way down. |
| **Show contrast sliders** | On | Turn it off to keep only brightness. Greyed out with inline sliders, which only show brightness. |
| **Adjust all external displays together** | Off | One brightness slider, and one contrast slider in the tile, set the same level on every external display. Until a slider is moved, it shows the average of the current levels; turning this on does not write to the displays. The laptop's own screen is never included. Greyed out with fewer than two external displays. |

Settings can also be changed from a terminal, with the key names `slider-placement` (`tile` or
`inline`), `inline-position` (`below` or `above`), `limit-minimum-brightness`, `show-contrast` and
`group-displays`, for example

```bash
gsettings --schemadir ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/multi-display-adjustment@cecilio.xyz/schemas \
    set org.gnome.shell.extensions.multi-display-adjustment slider-placement inline
```

## Dependencies

* GNOME 46-50
* [_ddcutil-service_](https://github.com/digitaltrails/ddcutil-service)

## Installation

Install it from
[extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/10707/multi-display-adjustment/), in
the browser or with an app such as Extension Manager. It also needs _ddcutil-service_, see
[below](#installation-of-ddcutil-service).

A new version shows up there once it passes review. To install a release before that, grab the
`.shell-extension.zip` of the
[latest release](https://github.com/samuelcecilio/multi-display-adjustment/releases/latest) and

```bash
gnome-extensions install --force multi-display-adjustment@cecilio.xyz.shell-extension.zip
```

Log out and back in, then enable it with

```bash
gnome-extensions enable multi-display-adjustment@cecilio.xyz
```

To build the package from a clone instead, run `make install` and log out and back in.
[dev.md](./dev.md) covers working on the extension itself.

### ddcutil-service

`ddcutil-service` can be installed from a package or built and installed from the source code.

#### From a package

* [Ubuntu and Debian packages](https://gitlab.com/w8jcik/ddcutil-service.deb)
* [Arch AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ddcutil-service)
* [OpenSUSE packages](https://software.opensuse.org/package/ddcutil-service)

#### Build by yourself

1. __Install dependencies `ddcutil`, `libddcutil` and `glib`__

   On Ubuntu and Debian

   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential git ddcutil libddcutil-dev libglib2.0-dev
   ```

   On Fedora (and likely other RPM based distributions)

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install make gcc git ddcutil libddcutil-devel glib2-devel
   ```

2. __Build and install the service__

   ```bash
   git clone --branch v1.0.14 https://github.com/digitaltrails/ddcutil-service.git
   cd ddcutil-service
   make
   make install
   ```

   Service installs to `~/.local/share/dbus-1/services/com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.service` and  `~/.local/bin/ddcutil-service`. It is activated after the next login. You might have to reboot for `ddcutil` to detect your display.

#### Access to the displays

`ddcutil` reaches the displays through the `/dev/i2c-*` devices, which the `i2c-dev` kernel module
provides. Usually nothing has to be set up: `ddcutil` installs a udev rule that gives the logged-in
user access to the I2C buses of the graphics card. That rule does not match every graphics card,
though, and some distributions do not load `i2c-dev` at boot. If `ddcutil detect` finds the displays
only with `sudo`, or not at all, see [I2C device permissions](https://www.ddcutil.com/i2c_permissions/)
in the ddcutil documentation.
