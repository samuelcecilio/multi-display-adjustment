# Development

## Clone

```bash
git clone git@github.com:samuelcecilio/multi-display-adjustment.git ~/Code/multi-display-adjustment
```

`make` on its own lists every target mentioned below.

## Getting the working tree into the shell

There are two ways, and they cannot be combined. `make status` tells which one is in place.

### Symlink

```bash
make link
```

Edits in the working tree are picked up by the next shell restart, with no need to rebuild.
`make link` compiles `schemas/` first: `getSettings()` looks for `schemas/gschemas.compiled` in
the extension directory, which for a symlink is this working tree. Re-run `make schemas` after
changing a `.gschema.xml` file.

The compiled schema can also be exercised without logging out:

```bash
gsettings --schemadir schemas set org.gnome.shell.extensions.multi-display-adjustment group-displays true
gsettings --schemadir schemas set org.gnome.shell.extensions.multi-display-adjustment show-contrast false
```

> [!WARNING]
> While this symlink exists, never run `gnome-extensions install --force`. It empties the extension
> directory before unpacking and follows the symlink while doing so, which **deletes the contents of
> the working tree**. `make install` checks for the symlink and refuses to run, but the plain
> `gnome-extensions` command does not.
>
> A symlinked extension does not show up in `gnome-extensions list`, so check with `make status` or
> `ls -l ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/` instead.

Undone with `make unlink`.

### Package

Installs a copy, which is what a user ends up with. Run `make uninstall` first if the symlink is in
place.

```bash
make install
```

## Reloading

On Wayland the shell cannot be restarted in place, so a full log out and back in is needed to pick
up changed extension code. On X11, `Alt`+`F2` followed by `r` is enough.

The extension is enabled with

```bash
make enable
```

which only works once the shell has seen the extension, so it has to happen after the first log in.

`make logs` follows what the shell writes to the journal. The extension's own messages only show up
once the `log` call in `devLog` is uncommented.

## Nested session

```bash
make nested
```

Useful for catching errors at startup without logging out. The displays of that session are virtual
and have no DDC/CI, so no sliders appear in it — the extension finds no matching display and hides
its tile. Errors from the extension appear on the standard error of the command.

It runs GNOME Shell headless, because GNOME Shell 50 dropped both `--nested` and
`MUTTER_DEBUG_DUMMY_MODE_SPECS`. Displays are simulated by repeating `--virtual-monitor`.

`make check` parses the sources, which catches a syntax error without starting a shell at all.
`make nested` compiles the GSettings schema first, because `getSettings()` throws if
`schemas/gschemas.compiled` is missing.

## Dbus examples

This extension is using a Mutter interface called `DisplayConfig`

Consider example of three displays
  * `DP-1` `1920x1200@59.950`
  * `DP-2` `2560x1440@59.951`
  * `HDMI-2` `1680x1050@59.954`

Example retrieval of display configuration from Mutter using GJS

```js
// gdbus call --session --dest=org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig --object-path /org/gnome/Mutter/DisplayConfig --method org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig.GetResources

const displayResources = await proxy.GetResourcesAsync()
console.log("[multi-display-adjustment] Display resources", displayResources)
const [rawSerial, crtcs, outputs, modes] = displayResources

// gdbus call --session --dest=org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig --object-path /org/gnome/Mutter/DisplayConfig --method org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig.GetCurrentState

const currentState = await proxy.GetCurrentStateAsync()
console.log("[multi-display-adjustment] Current displays state", currentState)
const [rawSerial, monitors, logicalMonitors, properties] = currentState
```

The human readable name of a display, the one Settings shows, comes from the `display-name` property
of a monitor, which is the third member of each entry of `monitors`.

```bash
gdbus call --session --dest=org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig \
  --object-path /org/gnome/Mutter/DisplayConfig \
  --method org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig.GetCurrentState | tr ',' '\n' | grep display-name
```

Reading and writing a VCP feature of a display, `0x10` (16) is brightness and `0x12` (18) is contrast.
The last two members of the reply are a status and a message, `DDCRC_REPORTED_UNSUPPORTED` being what
a display answers for a feature it does not have.

```bash
gdbus call --session --dest=com.ddcutil.DdcutilService \
  --object-path /com/ddcutil/DdcutilObject \
  --method com.ddcutil.DdcutilInterface.Detect 0

gdbus call --session --dest=com.ddcutil.DdcutilService \
  --object-path /com/ddcutil/DdcutilObject \
  --method com.ddcutil.DdcutilInterface.GetVcp 1 "" 16 0
```

## Logging

* Use `log` procedure to log messages, or uncomment the call in `devLog` to get the messages the
  extension already emits.
* Use `journalctl -f` to see messages.
